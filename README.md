### Customization
You can also download the `overrides.rar`, which can be used to customize the config.
- The `autoexec.cfg` runs after the config, so if you wish to add a command, do it in here
- The class configs (`scout.cfg`, `soldier.cfg`, `spy.cfg`, `sniper.cfg` etc) will be executed each time you use the selected class
